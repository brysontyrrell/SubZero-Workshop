### AWS Services / Features

### Module Challenge

The `GET /api/images` endpoint is not functioning. Compare the `List` Lambda function resource to the `Upload` functionn and add the missing elements required to grant S3 read permissions.

Reference the [SAM Policy Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-policy-templates.html) documentation to find the appropriate role.

As an additional challenge make use of SAM's `Globals` feature.
