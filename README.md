# SubZero Workshop

A serverless workshop for SubZero 2020.

## Modules

The workshop is split across 6 modules over the course of the day. Each module will include a brief lecture, guided hands on activity, and challenges. At the start of a module copy the contents of the directory into your working repository as directed by the workshop leads.

All challenges revolve around modifying CloudFormation templates and resources - you are not required to know or write Python as a part of this workshop. If you do complete the challenges it is recommended you copy the files for the next module and overwrite your changes.
